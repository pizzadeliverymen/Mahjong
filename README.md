I am trying to make a raw js/html/css website to play mahjong on

starting as a human controls all players, but I might switch to making a simple mahjong ai at some point

To run the game you have to type the following into the console:
```
ForcePlay(delay)
```
You can adjust how long the "AI" "players" take to "think" by changing the delay, I would suggest using a 0 delay
